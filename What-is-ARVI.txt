📊 ARVI (Advanced Relative Value Index)
ARVI is a custom-designed basketball metric developed for this project to estimate a player's relative contribution to team success using both opportunity and efficiency-based measures. It integrates multiple advanced statistics into a single, interpretable index that reflects each player's real-world value in the context of their team.

📐 Metric Definition
The ARVI metric is calculated as:

Edit
ARVI = (α · VORP_Share + β · BPM_Share) × (γ · MPG_Share + δ · USG_Share) × η × TS_Norm
Where:

VORP_Share: Player's Value Over Replacement (VORP) as a proportion of team total

BPM_Share: Box Plus/Minus normalized to the team average

MPG_Share: Minutes per game normalized to team total

USG_Share: Usage percentage normalized to team total

TS_Norm: True Shooting Percentage normalized to the team average

🎯 Conceptual Motivation
ARVI is designed to reflect not just raw output, but a player's scaled contribution relative to teammates:

High ARVI values typically indicate players with strong impact (VORP/BPM), large roles (minutes and usage), and above-average efficiency (TS%).

ARVI rewards players who are both heavily relied on and efficient — but adjusts for context, ensuring that bench players and stars are evaluated fairly within team structure.

🏀 Practical Application
This metric powers a machine learning model that predicts team win totals across an NBA season. Aggregated team-level ARVI features (sum, mean, max, standard deviation, top-3 sum) were found to be strong predictors of success, with ARVI standard deviation inversely correlated with win totals, highlighting the predictive value of roster balance.
